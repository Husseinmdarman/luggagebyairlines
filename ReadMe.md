# Lost, Damaged or Delay luggage

Thousands, if not hundrends of thousands of luggage is either damaged by the airline, lost or they end up being delayed while you're on holiday. 
This project implements a full end‑to‑end, production‑grade data engineering pipeline for processing airline baggage claims related to lost, damaged, and delayed luggage. 
It simulates a real operational environment where claim events flow through a modern, cloud‑native architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and analytics.
